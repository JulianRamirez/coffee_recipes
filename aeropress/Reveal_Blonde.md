Beans: 18.7g @ 12clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 302.1g @ 190°F

### Writeup ###

I did this inverted so I started by setting up the aeropress upside down with
the stopper in the bottom and the cap sitting on the side.  The cap happens to
be exactly the size of my mug so I generally put the filter in the cap, put it
on my mug and pour some water through to heat my mug + wash the filter.

That prepped, I poured 18.7 grams of beans ground at 12 clicks into the
aeropress on my scale. I then poured 72.6g of water and started the clock.
I stirred for ~20seconds, and poured in until the scale read 251.7 grams. I was
shooting for 250g so that was fine. I waited until the clock read 1:15 and then
flipped the aeropress on top of my mug. I give it a bit of a shake while doing
so to make sure the grinds are well distributed. Then I push slowly so I'm done
at 1:45.

### Notes ###

Tasty. Brings out a lot more of the acid than the v60 as expected. Still
chocolate-y but more chocolate orange. Cup gets sweeter as it cools, revealing
some caramels.
