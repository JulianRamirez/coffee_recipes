Beans: 52.9g @ 16clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 553.6g @ 202Â°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 109.6g of water, wait till it stops dripping, then have the
scale off and totally lose track

Pour in a spiral motion till near top of chemex filter.

Wait till about an inch from the top or so and then refill till you hit 550g total.

Wait till it drains.

Total: 4:31.39

### Notes ###

Lots of the same notes as the v60 but a notably cleaner cup. The problem is
that it tastes like those brown filters smell. ugh/. I'll try running more
water through them.
