### Writeup ###

One day it was hot in the office and I decided we needed iced tea. Normally
iced tea takes hours to make at room temperature so we made some tea inspired
by iced pour over. My logic here was to make tea at 1.5x strength but use ice
instead of 1/2 the water.

Normally I make tea at roughly 1:100 weight ratio. For this put in 15g of tea
and let it steep in 500g of water for 8 minutes. This ensures the tea is quite
concentrated. Then dump in 500g of ice and stir thoroughly. Pour into cup and
add some more ice depending on how cold you want your tea!

### Rough Timeline ###

0:00

    Boil water
    Pour in 15g of tea
    Pour in 600g water

8:00

    Remove tea strainer
    Add Ice
    Stir

### Notes ###

With the black tea I used there wasn't too much "black tea" flavor to be found.
The only flavor that really came through was the mango.
