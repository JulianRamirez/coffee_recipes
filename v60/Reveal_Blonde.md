Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

You want to start in the middle of the grounds and slowly make a spiral growing
outward to the rim, finishing by washing the sides down.

### Notes ###

I cleaned the grinder today and it seems to have helped the grind. I can't taste a difference but it ground much faster so the oil from the dark beans we had the last few weeks was definitely causing some slipping. 

Anyway I hit the flavor I had yesterday morning so I'm happy. The first sip has a lot of that charcoal flavor but as the coffee cools the chocolate-y caramel-y flavors peek out. No fruit at all today.
