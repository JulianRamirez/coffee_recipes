Beans: 36.4g @ 17clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 507.1g @ 200°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 96.8g of water, wait 32.48 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

You want to start in the middle of the grounds and slowly make a spiral growing
outward to the rim, finishing by washing the sides down.

Total: 3:04.07

### Notes ###

So the coffee is getting more stale since the last time I made it but lowering
the temperature combined with the new spiral technique has yielded some
surprisingly okay coffee. Starts a bit berry and heads to chocolate.

I think the bag strategy should definitely be to start at maybe 205°F or 206°F
and then slowly lower the temp a few degrees every few days until you kill the
bag.
