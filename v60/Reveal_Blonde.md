Beans: 36.0g @ 16clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 502.3g @ 204째F

Timeline:
Pour 86g of water, wait 30seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

Total: 2:27.39

### Notes ###

Tried 2째F cooler water today to try the theory of maybe I'm burning the beans
at 206째F. The flavor is better but I'm still not entirely finished tweaking.

Much more dark dark chocolate with a toffee finish than the previous
charcoal/burnt flavors I was getting.

Probably try at 202째F tomorrow.
