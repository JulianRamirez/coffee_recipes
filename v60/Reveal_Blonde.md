Beans: 36.0g @ 16clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 503.2g @ 202°F

Timeline:
Pour 77g of water, wait 36.77 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

I tend to not wash down the sides, as it seems to move water through the
grounds faster.

### Notes ###

Okay tried 202°F and it was great. Charcoal flavor lingers in the mouth, but up
front its all dark dark chocolate with some toffee to follow. Also getting
some... caramel? Something somewhat fruity. Now just have to see if this is
sustainable.
