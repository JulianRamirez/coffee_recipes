### Notes ###

Getting a lot of burnt notes. I'm seriously starting to wonder if the roaster
messed up this batch or if I'm totally doing something wrong. I haven't changed
*anything*. The chocolate is there still, with a bit of toffee sweetness but
its mostly just burnt.

A little cooler its much better; more chocolate, maybe even some milk chocolate
but the finish is still charcoal/burnt.
