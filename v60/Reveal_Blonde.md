Pour 95.4g of water, wait 46.78 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

### Notes ###

Late afternoon redux was not as successful. I think the kettle's PID is not as accurate as it could be. I set the kettle high on accident and let it cool but it tasted like it was over what I did this morning. Anyway it still had the flavor just a bit "off". Maybe a bit too much charcoal?
