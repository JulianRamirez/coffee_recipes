Beans: 37.0g @ 21clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 501.7g @ 200Â°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 106.1g of water, wait 28.77 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

You want to start in the middle of the grounds and slowly make a spiral growing
outward to the rim, finishing by washing the sides down.

Total: 02:02.64

### Notes ###

So I accidentally ground some beans wayyyy too big, and it totally worked out.
I think the quicker pour means it doesn't pick up some of the nastier flavors
but I don't know. Maybe it was a fluke?
