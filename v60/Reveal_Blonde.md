### Writeup ###

Put the kettle on to boil and fold out fresh filter. A filter can be folded by
folding down the cone along the ridge created by the seam. I tend to use water
that is a bit off boil (around 200째F-205째F) depending on the age of the coffee.

I then measure out roughly 36g of beans and make sure to set the grinder to
around 17 clicks. Definitely never ever forget. Generally I measure out a gram
or two extra because the grinder always eats a bit. The water should be done
now so pour water into your filter to get it thoroughly wet. This also
serves to warm up the cone and the mug/pot. Prep is now done.

I now poured 36.0g of beans into the wet filter. Shake the V60 a bit to settle
the grounds and then add a little dimple with one of your knuckles. This helps
create an even first pour. Then add 102.2g of water. The coffee didn't bloom
much because we buy our coffee in bulk. After 40.76seconds, I poured to 266.3g
of water. This roughly filled the 02 V60. I then took my spoon and stirred the
coffee a tiny bit. I poured up to 399.3g of water and stirred again. Then
I topped it off to 508.3g. After it finished draining, I dropped the filter
into the trash and enjoyed!

### Notes ###

Whoa adding the spoon totally adds crazy amounts of acid that wasn't present
before. I've tried this a few times thinking maybe the spoon was contaminated
but it seems to be repeatable. It still has a bit of the caramel and toffee but
bam all of a sudden citrus.
