Beans: 36.7g @ 21clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 502.1g @ 200Â°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 90.3g of water, wait 28.33 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

You want to start in the middle of the grounds and slowly make a spiral growing
outward to the rim, finishing by washing the sides down.

Total: 02:04.66

### Notes ###

Nope, worked out perfectly again. Boring, but a sturdy cup especially given
these beans are ... 4 weeks old? decent
