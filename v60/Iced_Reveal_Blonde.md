Beans: 43.3g @ 21clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 349.0g @ 200Â°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 101.5g of water, wait 30.10 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Same technique as hot coffee. Create the whirlpool, and let it drain a bit and
keep topping it off. I generally do a big pour to start, let it drain down,
wash down the sides and keep it topped off.

After you finish making the hot coffee, drop in some ice, stir, and enjoy. My
method for ice is make stronger coffee (hence the higher ratio) and then dilute
it with a lot of ice. I know its not very in the spirit of this repo, but it
works and its fun to taste the coffee as it dilutes more and more.

Total: 2:04.34

### Notes ###

Very sweet, with a lot of those caramel flavors.
