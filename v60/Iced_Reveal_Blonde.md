Beans: 50.0g @ 16clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 503.2g @ 200Â°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 86g of water, wait 36.10 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

I tend to not wash down the sides, as it seems to move water through the
grounds faster.

Drop in some ice, stir enjoy. My method for ice is make stronger coffee (hence
the 10:1 ratio above) and then dilute it with a lot of ice. I know its not very
in the spirit of this repo, but it works and its fun to taste the coffee as it
dilutes more and more.

Total: 2:34.34

### Notes ###

chocolate, caramel, and as it dilutes much fruitier notes but very little acid.
