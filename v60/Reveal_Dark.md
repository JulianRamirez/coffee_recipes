Beans: 36.1g @ 18clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 536.2g @ 200Â°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 82.4g of water, wait 31.41 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

I tend to not wash down the sides, as it seems to move water through the
grounds faster.

Total: 2:47.70

### Notes ###

Not bad. I was surprised. Obviously its very charcoal-y and has that really
earthy/dark flavor that any dark roast does but its moderately enjoyable.
Tomorrow I want to try to replicate this and then maybe try cold cold stuff. Oh
and really hit the 500g target.
