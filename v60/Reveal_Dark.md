Beans: 42.2g @ 12 clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 587.1g @ 190Â°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 109.0g of water, wait 32.43 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

I tend to not wash down the sides, as it seems to move water through the
grounds faster.

Total: 2:45.56

### Notes ###

Much bolder/pronounced flavors by dialing down the grind.
