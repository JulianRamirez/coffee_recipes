Beans: 36.2g @ 18clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 500.0g @ 200Â°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 100.0g of water, wait 30.33 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

I tend to not wash down the sides, as it seems to move water through the
grounds faster.

Total: 2:23.99

### Notes ###

Still really dark and a bit stronger. Lots of charcoal, some of that chocolate
and acid. Definitely want to try going to 190F to see if I can get rid of the
acid. Maybe 190F and a much finer grind will get me where I want.
