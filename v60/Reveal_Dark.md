Beans: 36.1g @ 18clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 504.0g @ 190°F

### Timeline ###

Pour 129.0g of water, wait 45.33 seconds
Pour rest, topping off as needed

Key is creating a whirlpool motion, spiraling as you pour as little as possible
water to maintain water level

I tend to not wash down the sides, as it seems to move water through the
grounds faster.

Total: 2:33.99

### Notes ###

Moving to 190°F was a good plan. A lot of the charcoal flavor is gone so the earthy and chocolatey flavors stand out.
