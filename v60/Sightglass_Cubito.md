Beans: 36.4g @ 17clicks on Baratza Encore

Water: 503.1g @ 202Â°F

### Timeline ###

Ahhhh the bloom for this is beautiful. I'll add a photo.

Let it bloom for 40.31 seconds

Then I pour about 200g of water to fill up the v2. Let it drain a bit, wash
down the sides and fill up the v2. Keep topping off until you hit 500g and let
it run off.

Total: 02:59.92

### Notes ###

Solid cup. Not too bright, not too dark, no real 'bitterness' or sourness.
Overall great but... boring. Thinking I need to maybe ramp up the temperature
to get more of that brightness and maybe a bit finer grind.
