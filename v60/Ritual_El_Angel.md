water to maintain water level

### Notes ###

Holy crap this coffee is sweet! Caramel and vanilla galore. Tastes like a dark
chocolate caramel ghirardelli square. 

Definitely thought I had screwed it up because of how long it took to pour out,
but now I need to try a finer grind at the office.

The bloom on this coffee makes me really question the coffee that Reveal brings
the office. I wonder if that is why the flavors have become so muted rather
than bitter.
