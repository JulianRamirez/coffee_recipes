notes:
  Having only drunk pour over coffee for some time, this was unbelievably thick
  and gritty. Had some really good flavor though. Very sort of dark, charcoal,
  dark chocolate flavor.

### Writeup ###

Start by pouring a bit of water into your press pot and let it heat up.

Put grinds into bottom of the pot and pour in your water. Stir for around
a minute and then put the cap on.

After 4 minutes, plunge and transfer to a different vessel or serve.

It usually takes me about 30 seconds to plunge. You want to plunge slowly to
avoid squirting out grounds or breaking the pot.
